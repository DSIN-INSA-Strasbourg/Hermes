## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Fixed an improper validation of the `from_raw_dict` and `from_json_dict` arguments of the Dataschema constructor, which treated an empty dictionary as if the argument had not been defined. Thanks to Julien Houchard for reporting and fixing this bug.

## [1.0.0-alpha.1] - 2024-04-29

### Added

- First release, by [@Boris Lechner](https://github.com/orgs/DSIN-INSA-Strasbourg/people/Boris-INSA). The code is stable enough to start testing it.
