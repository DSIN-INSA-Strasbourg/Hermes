        type: ldap
        settings:
          # MANDATORY : LDAP server URI
          uri: ldaps://ldap.example.com:636

            certfile: /path/to/client.crt # Facultative
            # Path to file with PEM encoded key for client cert authentication,

### fetch

Fetch entries from LDAP server.

```yaml

          fetch:
            type: fetch
            vars:
              # Facultative : the basedn to use for 'fetch' operation.
              # If unset, setting's basedn will be used
              base: "ou=exampleOU,dc=example,dc=com"
              # Facultative : the operation's scope for 'fetch' operation
              # Valid values are :
              # - base : to search the "base" object itself
              # - one, onelevel : to search the "base" objectâ€™s immediate children
              # - sub, subtree : to search the "base" object and all its descendants
              # If unset, "subtree" will be used
              scope: subtree
              # Facultative : the LDAP filter to use for 'fetch' operation
              # If unset, "(objectClass=*)" will be used
              filter: "(objectClass=*)"
              # Facultative : the attributes to fetch, as a list of strings
